#### PROJECT TRADE-OFFS AND SOLUTIONS 
<!-- Explain the trade-offs encountered during the project and how you addressed them and the solutions implemented to manage them -->

=== "Trade Off 1"
    - Describe the trade-off encountered (e.g., accuracy vs. computational efficiency).
      - Explain how you addressed this trade-off (e.g., by optimizing hyperparameters, using a more efficient algorithm, etc.).

=== "Trade Off 2"
    - Describe another trade-off (e.g., model complexity vs. interpretability).
      - Explain the solution (e.g., by selecting a model that balances both aspects effectively).
